Our first meeting with the [Advisory Board] (AB) took place via a conference call on Apr 23, 2018. All four project participants and six AB members attended this meeting. This was a major milestone of our project, which is about to approach the end of its first year. We have six members on the AB, whose expertise spans a wide spectrum of biological and computational sciences, and they are:
* [Jim Balhoff] (RENCI - Renaisssance Computing Institute), ontology developer and computational biologist
* [David Baum] (University of Wisconsin, Madison), botanist and systemtic biologist
* [Holly Bik] (University of California, Riverside), microbiologist, nematologist, and genomics-based biodiversity researcher
* [Chris Mungall] (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), ontology develper and computatioanl biologist
* [Susan Perkins] (American Museum of Natural History), parasitologist, systematic biologist
* [Michael Sanderson] (University of Arizona), botanist and systematic biologist

The phyloreferencing project team gave several presentations, concerning use cases, [roadmap and deliverables], and [curation tool]. In the overview, the need for carrying out this project was stated. Three [use cases] were presented, namely (1) querying [GBIF] using phyloreferences on the [Open Tree of Life] (OTL), (2) quantifying the resolvability of phyloreferences (on OTL), and (3) comparing relationships among phyloreferences on two phylogenies. We discussed a pratical challenge of resolving phyloreferneces, i.e., specifier matching. A live [demonstration] of the phyloreference curation tool was given. Four major deliverables of the project were outlined: (1) a [specification of phyloreference] construction and resolution, (2) an ontology of phyloreferences, (2) a proof-of-concept application for finding, resolving and validating phyloreferences on a given tree, and (4) a web application demonstrating large-scale biodiversity data integration. Each of these will be described in the following in some detail.

Members of the AB asked questions throughout the conference call. Some of these questions followed the presentations closely, while others were high-level, big picture questions. Questions were asked on the following issues: (1) if the three types of [phylogenetic clade definitions] were adequate and if they are widely used in databases, (2) plans to perform data integration with GBIF and EOL, (3) curation time investment, (4) the relationship between the ontology of phyloreferences (which we know call clade ontology) and the *Regnum*, and (5) the data structure of the *Regnum*. Two questions or suggestions were brought up after the meeting via email, one on the compatibility among phyloreferences on a given phylogeny, and another on querying a clade definition on the OTL.

We felt the most significant challenges facing us are mainly (1) an algorithmic method for matchinng specififiers and dealing with missing specifiers, (2) use case and tech development for a large-scale data integration application, and (3) engagement with trait (clade) oriented community and research groups. 

Overall the meeting was informative and productive, and filled with positive vibe and a fair amount of enthusiams from the AB. We are planning to have a in person AB meeting, which will afford the opportunity for more in-depth discussions and more constructive engagement in the various aspects of project development.
