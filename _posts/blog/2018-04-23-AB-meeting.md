Our first meeting with the [Advisory Board] (AB) took place via a conference call on Apr 23, 2018. All four project participants and six AB members attended this meeting. This was a major milestone of our project, which is about to approach the end of its first year. We have six members on the AB, whose expertise span a wide spectrum of biological and computational sciences.
* [Jim Balhoff] (RENCI - Renaisssance Computing Institute), ontology developer and computational biologist
* [David Baum] (University of Wisconsin, Madison), botanist and systemtic biologist
* [Holly Bik] (University of California, Riverside), microbiologist, nematologist, and genomics-based biodiversity researcher
* [Chris Mungall] (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), ontology develper and computatioanl biologist
* [Susan Perkins] (American Museum of Natural History), parasitologist, systematic biologist
* [Michael Sanderson] (University of Arizona), botanist and systematic biologist

We had a meeting [agenda] and were able to cover all the items on it. The conference call started with an overview of the Phyloreferencing project given by Nico. She outlined three major drawbacks of using taxonomic names to reference biodiversity knowledge, namely, taxonomic names are ambiguous, names are not available for many nodes of the Tree of Life, and their concepts are not machine interpretatble. The phyloreferencing project attempts to mitigate these problems by creating a way to make [phylogenetic clade definitions] (PCD) machine readable, which we call "phyloreferences". Nico described the three types of phylogenetic clade definitions. Mungall asked two questions around PCD - if these definitions are complete and how widely adopted they are in taxonomic databases. A brief exchange took place on these questions. Gaurav then took the stage and presented on use cases. He prepared three : querying GBIF using phyloreferences on the [Open Tree of Life] (OTL), quantifying the resolvability of phyloreferences (on OTL) and
