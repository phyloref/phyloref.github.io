A few months ago we [opened the search]({% post_url 2016-10-05-postdoc2-ad %}) for the second[^postdocs]
postdoc to join our project, a role which is expected to liaise with
large NSF-funded clade-oriented research projects (such as in
particular [GoLife] projects), and those developing informatics
infrastructure for comparative trait analysis (such as in particular
[ARBOR]). This search has recently concluded, and we are delighted
to welcome Dr. [Guanyang Zhang] to our team.

Guanyang is a taxonomist, an entomologist, and an evolutionary biologist. He obtained a
PhD in entomology from the University of California, Riverside (UCR),
where he worked in [Christiane Weirauch's lab] on the taxonomy,
phylogenetics, and evolution of assassin bugs (Reduviidae). After
graduating from UCR, he moved to Arizona State University to work as a
postdoctoral researcher with [Nico Franz]. His postdoctoral research
revolves around the phylogenetics and evolution of weevils, but his
interests also expanded to bacterial endosymbionts, weevil-host plant
associations, taxonomic concepts and environmental ontology.

Throughout his research, Guanyang found an imminent need to augment
the precision and universality of taxonomy for communicating and referencing biological information,
which is why he felt the phyloreferencing project is a natural fit for
expanding his training. He will be particularly involved in
developing and testing testing phyloreferences for insects and bacteria.

Guanyang participated in the [face-to-face project meeting]({%
post_url 2017-04-26-first-face-to-face-project-meeting %}) last
month, and will officially join the project in August. Please join us
in welcoming Guanyang!

[^postdocs]: The [original proposal](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1401984) mentions only one postdoc. NSF agreed to fund a second postdoc to allow a more substantive interaction with large clade-oriented research projects.
