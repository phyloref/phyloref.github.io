Gaurav and Guanyang attended a the Phenoscape Knowledgebase Hackathon hosted by Duke University. The hackathon was named ["Promoting Phenoscape KB Data Access and Interoperability Codefest, 2017"](https://github.com/phenoscape/KB-DataFest-2017). It was sponsored by [Phenoscape](http://phenoscape.org/), which is an informatics project that aims to  "create a scalable infrastructure that enables linking phenotypes across different fields of biology by the semantic similarity of their descriptions". The [goal](https://hackmd.io/s/Sk6Xa7Eq-#) of this hackathon was to "bring together a diverse group of people to collaboratively design and work hands-on on targets of their interest that take advantage and promote reuse of Phenoscape’s online evolutionary data resources and services". Altogether [28 researchers](https://github.com/phenoscape/KB-DataFest-2017/wiki/Participants) participated in this hackathon. 

Guanyang joined the [OpenTree](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/) sub-group, led by [Emily McTavish](https://mctavishlab.github.io/) and worked on a small project to match [Vertebrate Taxonomy Ontology (VTO)](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/VTO) ([Midford et al., 2013](https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2041-1480-4-34)) with the [Open Tree Taxonomy (OTT)](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/about/taxonomy-version/ott3.0). The VTO is used in Phenoscape Knowledge as its underlying taxonomy. It contains more than 100,000 taxonomic names compiled from multiple sources. 

Why is ther a need to match the two taxonomies, namely, VTO and OTT? Phenoscape contains trait (phenotypic) data, anchored to taxonomic names and  comparative analyses require phylogenetic trees.

Throughout the four-day workshp, a recurring theme is reconciling taxonomies.

[Matt Yoder](http://wwx.inhs.illinois.edu/directory/show/mjyoder) (Illinois Natural History Survey) demonstrated the nomenclature model of [Taxonworks](http://taxonworks.org/), which is an all-in-one biodiversity/taxonomic data management system. I was particularly impressed with the elegant and user-friendly sandbox interface. Further details about the nomenclature ontology in Taxonworks can be found in the [abstract](https://biss.pensoft.net/article/20284/) and [slides](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/nomen/blob/master/docs/presentations/Ballroom_A_Tuesday_1445_Yoder_TDWG17.pptx) of a talk given by Matt at [TDWG 2017](https://tdwg.github.io/conferences/2017/)
