## Software

* [Klados](https://github.com/phyloref/klados/): Web-based tool for curating published phylogenetic clade definitions to machine-readable phyloreferences (in Phyx files).
* [phyx.js](https://github.com/phyloref/phyx.js/): Javascript library for manipulating Phyx files (and converting them to OWL ontologies). ([NPM release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@phyloref/phyx))
* [phylo2owl](https://github.com/phyloref/phylo2owl): Tool to convert phylogenies to OWL ontologies.
