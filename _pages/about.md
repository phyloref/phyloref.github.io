## About phyloreferencing 

Phyloreferencing aims to provide a standard mechanism for defining
biological clades with precise and fully machine-processible
semantics. The name is in analogy to the ubiquitous mechanism of
_georeferencing_, which instead of ambiguous geographic place names
uses geographic coordinates to enable powerful computation for
geography-linked data.

Phyloreferencing uses machine-interpretable definitions of the unique
pattern of evolutionary descent that distinguishes a clade from all
others. A clade defined in this way can include thousands of species,
or can identify a monophyletic subgroup within a species. In contrast
to authoritative nomenclatural naming, our goal is to allow users to
construct phyloreferences instantly for any group of shared
evolutionary descent for which they wish to communicate (or obtain)
data.

## Why phyloreferencing

Traditionally, scientists have used taxon names based in Linnaean
nomenclature to communicate, obtain, and aggregate organism-linked
data. However, doing so suffers from serious limitations. The
semantics of suchtaxon names are too often ambiguous, subject to
divergent interpretation, and, perhaps most importantly, unavailable
to computation. And with the advent of next-generation sequencing,
metagenomics, and other modern biological data collection
technologies, many groups of organisms for which we have interesting
data do not yet, and may never have a Linnaean name. Hence, Linnaean
names fundamentally hamper our ability to communicate and aggregate
organism-linked data freely, and precisely.

Phyloreferencing overcomes these limitations by defining
ontology-based references to elements on the Tree of Life that are
unambiguous and the semantics of which are amenable to powerful
machine reasoning, making clade definitions fully computable.

A fuller account of the rationale and arguments for phyloreferencing
can be found in Cellinese et al. (2022) “[Phyloreferences:
Tree-Native, Reproducible, and Machine-Interpretable Taxon Concepts](https://doi.org/10.3998/ptpbio.2101)”,

## History

The roots of Phyloreferencing as an idea go back to a [group of
scientists at the 2009 Phyloinformatics VoCamp][VoCamp subgroup] (a
codefest-type event for vocabulary and ontology development), held in
conjunction with [TDWG 2009], the annual conference of the [Biodiversity
Information Standards] organization. Leaning on the [PhyloCode] for
symbolism, the group, which included Nico and Hilmar, developed ways
to express clade definitions as metadata queries against a database of
phylogenetic trees.

The core informatics ideas underlying this project, namely using
formal ontologies and machine reasoning to express universally
computable clade definitions, go back in large part to the [RegNum]
database of phylogenetic clade definitions, and the work of [Phenoscape]
on using formal ontologies and machine reasoning to enable large-scale
computing with phenotype observations across disparate sources and
communities of practice. The fundamental issues in using names to
communicate data about anatomical concepts (such as phenotypes) turn
out to be very similar to those faced in using (Linnaean) names to
communicate data about groups of organisms. In a way, we translate the
techniques developed for computing with phenotype descriptions to
revolutionize the ways we can use computation to integrate data by
groups of organisms, unconstrained by the limitations of nomenclature.

As its theoretical underpinnings, our work builds on more than a
decade’s worth of theoretical and applied research into phylogenetic
taxonomy.
